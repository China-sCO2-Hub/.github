## Hi there 👋


NerdWallet for Industrial Green-Tech. We audit Chinese sCO2 suppliers so you don't have to.

Hey 👋

I'm a solo dev who just spent a year diving deep into a niche you've probably never heard of: **Supercritical CO2 (sCO2) technology**.

It's a game-changer for industrial energy efficiency, but the best hardware comes from China, and Western buyers are terrified of getting burned. The "trust gap" is massive.

China sCO2 Hub is my solution. It's not another B2B directory. It's an **E-E-A-T-first platform** that helps technical directors and procurement leads make multi-million dollar decisions with confidence.

**Key Features (aka "My Sacred Objects"):**
*   **The Cost of Inaction Calculator:** An ROI simulator that shows you the *daily financial loss* of sticking with old tech. Uses loss-aversion psychology to drive action.
*   **Industrial Audit Tool (Powered by Gemini AI):** Upload a thermal diagram of your factory, and our Gemini-powered auditor identifies the best spots for **waste heat recovery** using **sCO2** systems.
*   **Trust & Compliance Registry:** We don't just list suppliers; we provide a protocol to verify their CE-PED, TUV, and material (like **GH4169** alloy) certifications.

I built this solo using React, Vite, Tailwind, and a whole lot of Gemini API calls. It's a statically generated site that's fast, secure, and ready to tackle a $50B market.

Would love to hear your feedback on the approach and the tech! I'm here all day to answer questions.
